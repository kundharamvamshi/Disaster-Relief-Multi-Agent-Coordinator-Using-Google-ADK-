**📘 Disaster Relief Multi-Agent Coordinator**

A Multi-Agent Disaster Response System built for the Kaggle × Google Agentic AI Intensive Program (Agents for Good Track).

The Disaster Relief Multi-Agent Coordinator is an intelligent agentic system that detects real-time environmental hazards, evaluates risk, and generates coordinated emergency response plans using Google ADK, custom tools, weather alert engines, and Google Maps API–based geospatial intelligence.
It features an interactive disaster map, live alert ingestion, automated volunteer assignment, shelter routing, and structured plan generation powered by multi-agent reasoning.

This project demonstrates how AI agents can assist public safety organizations, NGOs, and emergency authorities in making faster and more informed decisions during floods, earthquakes, cyclones, and other emergencies.
